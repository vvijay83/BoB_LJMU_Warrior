## Positive pay confirmation:

Positive Pay Confirmation is a safeguard against fraud committed by tampering with or altering checks. Positive Pay System entails the drawer re-confirming key details of the cheque to the bank, which are then cross-checked with the presented cheque during payment processing.

## Idea:

The proposed idea focuses on automatic cheque processing, which adds an extra layer of security to positive pay by automating the process of bank cheque leaf verification and fraud detection.
