## Positive pay confirmation:

Positive Pay Confirmation is a safeguard against fraud committed by tampering with or altering checks. Positive Pay System entails the drawer re-confirming key details of the cheque to the bank, which are then cross-checked with the presented cheque during payment processing.

## Idea:

The proposed idea focuses on automatic cheque processing, which adds an extra layer of security to positive pay by automating the process of bank cheque leaf verification and fraud detection.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt="GIF" 

1. Go [**`here`**]([https://github.com/milaan9/93_Python_Data_Analytics_Projects](https://github.com/akbism/BoB_LJMU_Warrior)) and click the big green ➞ **`Code`** button in the top right of the page, then click ➞ [**`Download ZIP`**](https://github.com/akbism/BoB_LJMU_Warrior/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

    ![Download ZIP](https://github.com/milaan9/93_Python_Data_Analytics_Projects/blob/main/img/dnld_rep.png)

2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.
    
3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    `Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
